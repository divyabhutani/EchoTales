# EchoTales

EchoTales is a Python-based project designed to create interactive audio experiences. This guide will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3**: Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. It is recommended to have only Python 3 installed to avoid version conflicts.
- **pip**: Make sure `pip` is installed and updated for managing Python packages.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Extract and Open the Project

- Download and extract the EchoTales zip file.
- Open the extracted folder in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, IntelliJ).

### 2. Verify Python Installation

- Open the terminal and run the following command to check if Python 3 is installed:

  ```bash
  which python3
  ```

  This should return the path to Python 3. If it does not, ensure that Python 3 is correctly installed on your system.

### 3. Run the Project File

- Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and attempt to run the main Python file:

  ```bash
  python3 echotales.py
  ```

  If this does not work, try specifying the full path to your Python 3 installation and the `echotales.py` file:

  ```bash
  /path/to/python3 /path/to/echotales.py
  ```

### 4. Install Required Python Libraries

- Ensure that `pip` is installed and updated by running the following commands:

  ```bash
  python3 -m ensurepip
  python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```

- Install the necessary Python libraries:

  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install pysofaconventions
  python3 -m pip install scipy
  python3 -m pip install pygame
  ```

### 5. Install PyAudio

- Installing PyAudio requires `Homebrew` and `PortAudio`. Follow these steps:

  - **Install Homebrew:**

    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

    After running the above command, the terminal will provide you with two additional commands for the next steps. Please execute those.

  - **Install PortAudio:**

    ```bash
    brew install portaudio
    ```

  - **Now install PyAudio:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install pyaudio
    ```

### 6. Run the Project

- Once all dependencies are installed, you can run the project:

  ```bash
  python3 echotales.py
  ```

  The project should now run successfully.
